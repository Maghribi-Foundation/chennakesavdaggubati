Blockchain
Basics
•	Decentralized
•	Transparent
•	Speed
•	Immutable and security 
•	Remove counterparty risk
•	Trust minimized agreements math-based agreements
•	Hybrid Smart contracts combine on and off-chain: smart contracts with oracle(data)


DAO’s: decentralized autonomous organizations
For governance: digital world

Wallet: Metamask
Recovery Phrase: 
wire liberty domain bamboo total heart napkin phrase glue path response prison

Etherscan: block explorer
An application that helps us view the transaction that happen on blockchain

Gas is a unit of computational measure the more computation uses the more gas you need to pay 
Every transaction on the chain pays a gas fee to node operator
Gas: measure of computation use
Gas price: how much it costs per unit of gas
Gas limit: Max amount of gas in transaction

Transaction fees: Gas used * Gas price

Ethgasstation.info
Hash function used by Ethereum is keccak256

Genesis Block: first block in the blockchain

Mining: process of solving the blockchain problem
Ex: Our problem is to find th hash with 4 zeros
Nodes get paid for mining blocks
Block: list of transactions mined together
Nonce: A ‘number used once’ to find the solution to the blockchain problem

Nonce is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address

Public key algorithm used for both bitcoin and ethereal is Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)

Private key is used to sign the transaction 
Public key is generated from the private key and used to verify the transaction

Node: a single instance in the decentralized network

Blockchain is resilient: at least one node is running. 
Blockchain nodes keep lists of transaction that occur

Consensus: is a mechanism used to agree on the state of the blockchain
Which divided into 1. Chain selection 2, sybil Resistance

Sybil Resistance mechanism: Proof of work(PoW) and Proof of State

Pow: finding the correct solution: who the block author is
Block time: time between block being published
Depending on the block time the problem is made (Hard or easy)

Chain Selection: nakamoto consensus : Combination of thePoW and longest chain of blocks is the chain of use
 chain which has a greater number of blocks

Block confirmation

Miners: Proof of work
Validators: Proof of stake

Proof of work uses lot of energy
Node will be getting paid if it solves the problem first and it will be paid 
As 1. Transaction fees 
2. Block reward
Block rewards are only paid until certain amount of time and after miners are paid only transaction fees
Gas fees are paid only by the one who does the transaction

Attacks in Blockchain:
1.	Sybil attack: when user creates whole bunch of pseudo-anonymous accounts to influence a network
2.	51% attack; th chain which becomes 51%more than a networks becomes the longest and with more nodes in a network could execute this attack

Proof of stake is a protocol which reduces the problem of Pow which consumes lot of energy (electricity)

Proof of stake nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism.
If they miss behave, they cut the stake/slashed
Nodes are randomly chosen Validators are used to validate whether they behaved honestly
Pros of PosS:
1.	Less energy: only one node to do this and other nodes should validate
2.	Sybil resistance mechanism
Cons:
1.	Less decentralized
2.	Environmental effect

Scalability: when more people use blockchain gas cost increase
No enough block space to get the transactions

Eeth 2.0 : solves POS and sharing

Sharding: blockchain of blockchain, the are connected to main chain

Layer1; base layer blockchain solutions
Layer: any applications work on the layer1 blockchains: chainlink, 
Sharing and rollups solve scalability problem

Recap:
Eth and btc are based on Proof of work 
Eth 2.0 is based on Proof of Stake
PoW & PoS mechanism prevent sybil attacks
The bigger the blockchain the secure it is
Consensus is how blockchain decides what the state of the chain is
